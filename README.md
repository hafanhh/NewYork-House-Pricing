**# Project Summary: Predictive Analysis of Real Estate Prices in New York City - Python**

**Background:**

This project aims to analyze and predict house prices in New York City based on a dataset with various features such as broker title, house type, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, location details, and more.

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- Calculated average, median, minimum, and maximum house prices.
- Analyzed property size statistics.
- Explored the distribution of the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Broker Analysis:**
- Identified the most active broker (COMPASS) and brokers with the highest average prices (e.g., Garfield, Leslie J. & Co. Inc).
- Explored the broker selling the largest houses (Link Ny Realty).

**House Type Analysis:**
- Investigated the most common house type (Co-op for sale) and analyzed its characteristics.
- Explored the highest-priced house type (Townhouse for sale) and the largest houses.

**Bedrooms and Bathrooms Analysis:**
- Analyzed the distribution of houses based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- Identified the most popular configurations and explored extreme cases with 30-40 bedrooms or 13-24 bathrooms.

**Borough Analysis:**
- Analyzed house distribution and average prices across boroughs.
- Highlighted Manhattan as the most popular borough with the highest average prices.

**Percentage Analysis:**
- Calculated the percentage of houses in Manhattan and the percentage of 'Co-op for sale.'
- Explored the percentage of houses with 3 beds and 2 baths.

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Investigated correlations between house features and prices.
- Identified features with the highest positive and negative correlations (e.g., property size, Manhattan location).


**Recommendations:**

- Focus on Co-op for sale properties, as they constitute a significant portion of the market (30.31%).
- Explore opportunities in Manhattan, where the majority of houses are located (72.59%).
- Consider the potential of Townhouse for sale properties, which command the highest average prices.
- Investigate the correlation between property size, Manhattan location, and house prices for strategic investments.

**Achievements:**

- Developed a comprehensive understanding of the New York City real estate market.
- Identified key influencers on house prices, enabling targeted investment strategies.
- Provided insights for brokers to optimize listings based on property characteristics.
- Established a foundation for predictive modeling to enhance future price predictions.
- This project lays the groundwork for further analysis and modeling to improve predictions and provide more actionable insights for real estate stakeholders in New York City.
